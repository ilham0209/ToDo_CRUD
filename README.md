ToDo_CRUD

ToDo_CRUD is a simple yet functional web application developed using the Next.js framework.This project focuses on demonstrating the core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a clear and straightforward manner.

The application successfully implements the following key features:
1 .Adding items to the list through a form with all required fields
2 .Removing items from the list using dedicated delete buttons
3 .Summarizing the list by displaying a count of total items
4 .Persisting data locally using localStorage, allowing the list to remain even after refreshing
the page
This project is designed to showcase how CRUD operations can be implemented effectively in a
modern web framework like Next.js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
